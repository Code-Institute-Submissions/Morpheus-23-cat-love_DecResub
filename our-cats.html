                            He plays with every toy we offer him. He likes sleeping with a warm human body at night,

                            watching birds. He enjoys watching humans brush their teeth, comb their hair, shower, bathe,
                            cook, clean. </h4>

                            his head in your neck. He is a first class snuggle bug. </h4>
                        <h4 class="adopt-me">Special needs: Yes, he has a special diet for treatment of his IBD. He also
                            receives vitamin B injections every 14 days and an appetite stimulant from time to time. Due
                            to his age and health challenges we will only consider applicants that have no small
                            children, no other animals and is comfortable with giving a cat medication. He needs a lot
                            of love and attention. He shared a home with an elderly gentleman that rescued Dumbledore as
                            a kitten. His human recently passed away.

                            on human ankles, feet and hands. She plays until she flops down to take a power nap. A few
                            minutes later she will be back to chasing down human toes, ankles and whatever else tickles
                            her fancy in the moment. </h4>

                            was surrendered by a family that adopted her as a kitten, but could no longer provide for
                            her. We suspect that she has been through some trauma and noticed that she is petrified of
                            dogs, even if they are small and friendly. She likes a quiet home, soft warm beds that are
                            high from the ground, such at the top of a cat tower. If you are patient with her, she will
                            start purring and rubbing against your hand.</h4>
                        <h4 class="adopt-me">Special needs: Due to her nervousness, we will only consider applications
                            if there are no dogs in the home and if there are other cats, they would need to be very
                            gentle towards Skyelah.</h4>

                            dogs and maybe even a bird or two. He will be great in a home with children and other
                            animals. He will ask you for food and pets and when he feels like it, he will just wander
                            off and entertain himself. He also loves being in the vicinity of people and other animals.
                            If you pick him up, he will make himself comfortable on your lap or just drape himself over
                            your
                            shoulder. His human recently emigrated to New York and did not want to put him through the

                            leash, he sits in his cat basket in the front of a bicycle and watches the world go by, he
                            enjoys going to parks and watching people strecth out on their blankets. He will walk up to
                            strangers and start talking his own cat language, however it is clear that he wants
                            attention and maybe a good conversation.
                            He guards the front door of his home, and he is always willing to greet any visitors. He
                            evens seems disappointed if there is a delivery at the front door, and he does not get the
                            pleasure of a decent greeting.

                            about her start in life, but she seems to be a confident girl. She likes people and animals.
                            She does not mind where she sleeps, if she is tired she just snuggles anywhere. If you call
                            her she will stand closer for some headrubs, but if you ignore her she keeps busy with her
                            own cat things. We do believe she deserves to be spoiled a bit and will fit into just about

                            She
                            is very enthusiastic about anything that happens on a kitchen counter.
                            We think she wanted to be a chef. Her human left due to Brexit. She preferred to stay on
