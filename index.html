                        <p>
                            We have always loved and cared for cats. Strays, rescues, rehomed cats, young and old. We
                            love
                            them all the same. So yet another day, another adventure and yes of course a cat crossed
                            our path. It was clear that our little furry friend was in need off a home. We had to get
                            him
                            off the streets. We took the little guy to the nearest vet where he was treated for all
                            kinds of
                            nasties that his little body endured from living out in the elements. He was not
                            microchipped
                            and we placed flyers all over the city, trying to get him back home, if he had one. It soon
                            became clear that the furry traveler had no place to call home. Our home was already full
                            with
                            resident cats and fosters. We no longer had and family, friends, neighbours or colleauges
                            that
                            wished to adopt another cat. So, off course he came home with us and we started the process
                            of
                            rescueing, socialising and rehoming cats, from all over.

                        <p>
                            The short answer is, from all over Europe. We are contacted by the public to assist when
                            strays
                            in our area are found, however we are mostly contacted by animal shelters
                            and rescue organisations to assist when they find large cat colonies. The kittens and
                            younger
                            cats are all fostered and rehomed within 3 months, however some of the older cats take a bit
                            more time to adjust the the comforts of having a home and a human to love.
                            We live in a cat loving community and we still find cats close to home that have either lost
                            their way, or dont have a
                            human to snuggle with. All our cats are firstly checked and treated by the local
                            veterinarian.
                            All cats are
                            checked for
                            microchips whereafter flyers are posted at all veterinarian offices, pet shops and rescue
                            centres within a
                            10km radius from where a cat is found. We place photographs
                            of the cats on social media and target the areas where they are found. The cats are then
                            fostered for a minimum period of 3 months, during which we allow more time for owners to
                            claim
                            their lost cat or for the cats to be properly monitored and socialised. Complete health
                            checks
                            are carried out, and we are truly humbled to say that even though we have encountered a few
                            felines with medical challenges, they have all found loving homes.
