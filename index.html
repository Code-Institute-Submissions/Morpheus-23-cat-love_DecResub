                <h2>Humans helping cats <i class="fas fa-paw"></i> </h2>
                <p>We have always loved and cared for cats. Strays, rescues, rehomed cats, young and old. We
                    love them all the same.
                    So yet another day, another adventure and yes of course a cat
                    crossed our path. It was clear that our little furry friend was in need off a home. We had
                    to get him off the streets. We took the little guy to the nearest vet where he was treated
                    for all kinds of "nasties" that his little body endured from living out in the elements. He
                    was not microchipped.
                    We placed flyers all over the city, trying to get him back home. It soon became clear that
                    the furry traveler had no place to call home. Our home was already full with resident cats
                    and fosters. We no longer had any family, friends, neighbours or colleagues that wished to
                    adopt another cat.
                    So he came home with us. That, my fellow feline lover, is when we started the process of rescuing,
                    socialising and rehoming cats.

                <h2>Where do they come from? <i class="fas fa-cat"></i></h2>
                <p> Our rescued cats come from all over Europe. We are contacted by the public to assist when
                    strays are found, however we are mostly contacted by animal shelters and rescue
                    organisations to assist when they find large cat colonies. The kittens and younger
                    cats are all fostered and mostly rehomed within four to six weeks following rescue. Some of the
                    older cats take a bit more time to adjust to the comforts of having a home and a human to love.
                    Even though we live in a cat loving community, we still find cats in our area that dont have
                    a human to snuggle with.
                    All cats are checked for microchips. If we are unable to determine whether the cat has their
                    own human, flyers are posted at all veterinarian offices, pet shops and rescue centres
                    within a 10km radius from where the cat is found. We place photographs of the cats on social
                    media and target the areas where they are found. The cats are then fostered during which we
                    allow more time for owners to claim their lost cat and for the cats to be properly monitored
                    and socialised. All our cats are thoroughly examined by the local veterinarians, and medical
                    treatments are started where necessary.
                    Complete health checks are carried out and we are truly humbled to say that even though we
                    have encountered a few felines with medical challenges, they have all found loving homes.

                <h2>To love a cat....<i class="fas fa-paw"></i></h2>
                <p><em><i>“What greater gift than the love of a cat.” - Charles Dickens</i></em></p>
                <br>
                <p>Are you considering adopting a cat? Having a little furry friend can be very rewarding. If you have
                    not cared for a cat before, here are a few things to consider:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Basic needs: Daily fresh food and water, stimulation such as toys and play time with you,
                            litterbox options and provision for medical expenses.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Left alone: Cats have a reputation of being distant, however in our experience this has
                            always turned out to be the opposite. If you take time to get to know them and win their
                            trust, they become very friendly and interactive.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Other pets: If you already have other pets, there is a risk that a newly adopted cat may
                            struggle to settle in your home. This also depends on how social your other pets are.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Children: Some cats can be afraid of little energetic humans. Consider the character and
                            age of the cat and whether the animal is a good match for your existing household.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Aging cats: Just like humans, cats may develop all sorts of challenges and ailments as
                            they age, so it is important that they also live a healthy life. Give them the best food
                            that you can reasonably afford, regular medical checkups and a quiet place to sleep. When
                            they reach the end of their journeys, be there for them. They need to know they are loved
                            until the very end.
                        </li>
