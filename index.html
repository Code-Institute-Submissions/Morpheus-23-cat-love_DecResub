                        <p>
                            We have always loved and cared for cats. Strays, rescues, rehomed cats, young and old. We
                            love them all the same. 
                            So yet another day, another adventure and yes of course a cat
                            crossed our path. It was clear that our little furry friend was in need off a home. We had
                            to get him off the streets. We took the little guy to the nearest vet where he was treated
                            for all kinds of "nasties" that his little body endured from living out in the elements. He
                            was not microchipped.
                            We placed flyers all over the city, trying to get him back home. It soon became clear that
                            the furry traveler had no place to call home. Our home was already full with resident cats
                            and fosters. We no longer had any family, friends, neighbours or colleagues that wished to
                            adopt another cat. 
                            So he came home with us and that, my fellow feline lover, is when we
                            started the process of rescuing, socialising and rehoming cats.

                        <h2>Where do they come from? <i class="fas fa-cat"></i></h2>
                        <p>
                            The short answer is, from all over Europe. We are contacted by the public to assist when
                            strays are found, however we are mostly contacted by animal shelters and rescue
                            organisations to assist when they find large cat colonies. The kittens and younger
                            cats are all fostered and rehomed within four to six weeks. Some of the older cats take a
                            bit more time to adjust to the comforts of having a home and a human to love.
                            Even though we live in a cat loving community, we still find cats in our area that dont have
                            a human to snuggle with.
                            All cats are checked for microchips. If we are unable to determine whether the cat has their
                            own human, flyers are posted at all veterinarian offices, pet shops and rescue centres
                            within a 10km radius from where the cat is found. We place photographs of the cats on social
                            media and target the areas where they are found. The cats are then fostered during which we
                            allow more time for owners to claim their lost cat or for the cats to be properly monitored
                            and socialised. All our cats are thoroughly examined by the local veterinarians, and
                            treatments are started where necessary.
                            Complete health checks are carried out and we are truly humbled to say that even though we
                            have encountered a few felines with medical challenges, they have all found loving homes.

                            “What greater gift than the love of a cat.” - Charles Dickens

                        <p>Are you considering bringing a cat into your life / home ?</p>
                        <p>Having a little furry friend can be enormously rewarding. If you have had the pleasure of
                            sharing your life with a cat, no
                            need to explain. However, if you are a newbie contemplating here are a few things to
                            consider:</p>
                        <p>
                            basic needs, such as food, freshwater daily, stimulation such as playtime and toys, having
                            access to a safe outside environment, litterbox options, provision for medical care if and
                            when needed, prevention and/or treatment of ticks and fleas, mites, and whatever else
                            may upset your furry friend
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            left alone: cats have a reputation of being distant, however, in our experience this has
                            always turned out to be the opposite. it is about taking the time and getting to know your
                            cat, understanding their needs and fears. once you grasp their needs and treat them
                            accordingly, you will discover that these furry little friends are very much dependant on
                            their humans for love, interaction, friendship, security, and not just for food and catnip.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            other animals: if you already have another cat/cats and/or dogs, there is a risk that
                            a newly adopted cat may struggle to settle in your home, this also depends on your other
                            animals
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            young children: some cats could be skittish and not trusting of little energetic humans.
                            consider the character and age of the cat whether the animal will be a good addition to your
                            family
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            aging cats: just as us humans, cats may develop all sorts of challenges and ailments as they
                            age. it is just as important that they live as healthy as possible. give your cat the best
                            food that you can reasonably afford, freshwater daily, let them have regular vet check-ups,
                            nice safe spots to sleep and rest, and when they reach the end of their journeys, be there
                            for them. they need to know they are loved until the very end.
                        </p>
