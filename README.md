# for LOVE of CATS (fLoC)

[for LOVE of CATS](https://morpheus-23.github.io/cat-love/) is a website for people who want to adopt a rescued cat. It enables people to browse through a list of cats that are available for adoption and gives information about each cat. It also allows people to send their contact information along with the name of the cat they are interested in.

### Strategy

 - The main aim and focus of fLoC are to establish a reputation as a reputable/trustworthy rescuer that constantly rescues feral and/or homeless cats and find safe and loving homes where the cats can happily live out the remainder of their 9 lives.
 - For fLoC it is of utmost importance to:
    - rescue cats living on the streets / from vulnerable situations;
    - rehabilitate/socialise the cats before opening them up to adoption;
    - find good and loving homes for the adoptable cats;
    - find foster homes to help rehabilitate/socialise cats/kittens until they are ready to be adopted;
    - find other rescuers, whether individuals and/or organisations to collaborate efforts to enable more cats to be rescued from the streets / undesirable situations;
    - create an online presence to enable other rescuers, potential foster homes, potential adopters to make contact with fLoC to help as many cats as possible;
- For a further release:
    - Once fLoC is well established and growing in efforts, the intention is to attract donors such as companies producing and/or selling cat food, treats, accessories, medical supplies and supplements. 
    - When fLoC has a well-established following, it may consider endorsing products for cats, provided that the production and distribution of said products are in line with the aim of fLoC, thus no harm to cats in any way or form.  No harm to any animal during the product research, product development, production, or distribution of any products will be tolerated/endorsed.

### Scope

- Release 1: the functional specifications
    - For the launch of the website the following critical pages should form part of the first release:

        - Adoption request page, enabling potential adopters to apply for the adoption of a specifically selected cat, from the Our Cats page;
        - Find Us page, enabling potential adopters, collaborators, and the general public who may have information about cats needing rescue to make contact with fLoC.

- Release 2: future specifications intended for release following the initial website launch:
    - For the next release, the following pages should be added:
        - Rescue success stories, making provision for messages and photographs to be submitted to fLoC and published by fLoC following administrator approval and to motivate potential adoptees or persons needing to surrender their cat to contact fLoC;

- Release 3:

        - Volunteer application page, providing for potential volunteers to submit a photograph, a cv and a cover letter.

### Structure

- The purpose of the website is to attract potential cat adopters, thus helping feral and/or homeless cats find good homes. 
- The website is kept fairly simple and very easy to navigate, ensuring a positive user experience.  The structure was developed with that in mind.
- The initial website consists of four pages:
    - Our Story
    - Our Cats
    - Adoption request
    - Find us
- The initial pages all have the following structure:
    - Logo: All the pages have a clickable logo which provides for easy navigation back to the home page;
    - Navigation bar: Located on each page enabling the user to easily locate it and navigate the site;
    - Hero Images: Each page has a different hero image that uses a zoom animation and each page has a colour theme, which theme matches the clickable navigation bar item;
    - Footer: Pinned at the bottom of each page and contains social media links for easy sharing of fLoC efforts and experiences.
